# Scheduler Machine Coding Problem

## Context
You are given a simple Python scheduler. Extend it to support additional functionality.

## Tasks

### Software Engineer (SE)
- Add cancellation (`cancel(task_id)`)
- Prevent duplicate task IDs
- Write unit tests

### Senior Software Engineer (SSE)
- Add recurring tasks
- Use a priority queue for efficiency
- Handle task errors gracefully
- Add pause/resume functionality

### Lead Engineer (LE)
- Scale to millions of tasks
- Support distributed scheduling
- Add metrics collection
- AI-first features (smart prioritization, predictive scheduling)

## Setup
Run `demo.py` to see example usage.
Run tests using `python -m unittest discover -s tests`.
